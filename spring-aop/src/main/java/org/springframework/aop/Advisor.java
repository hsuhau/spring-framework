/**
 * Base interface holding AOP <b>advice</b> (action to take at a joinpoint)
 * and a filter determining the applicability of the advice (such as
 * a pointcut). <i>This interface is not for use by Spring users, but to
 * allow for commonality in support for different types of advice.</i>
 *
 * <p>Spring AOP is based around <b>around advice</b> delivered via method
 * <b>interception</b>, compliant with the AOP Alliance interception API.
 * The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice,
 * such as <b>before</b> and <b>after</b> advice, which need not be
 * implemented using interception.
 *
 * <p>这个接口（Advisor）在Spring的AOP框架和AOP Alliance的拦截API之间充当桥梁的角色。它封装了通知（advice），并提供了一种检查通知是针对特定实例还是在实例间共享的方法。
 *
 * <p>需要注意的是，Spring AOP围绕拦截器和通知（advice）展开，允许开发人员以模块化和可重用的方式应用诸如日志记录、安全性和事务管理等横切关注点。Advisor接口是在Spring生态系统中实现这种面向切面编程范式的关键组成部分。
